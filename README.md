Wayfinder Bracelet
Screen-free haptic navigation for a smarter, greener journey.

Wayfinder is a wearable technology project designed to make navigation intuitive and accessible without needing to constantly look at a screen. It's built for cyclists, pedestrians, and individuals with disabilities who want to stay focused on their surroundings while still getting accurate, turn-by-turn directions.
